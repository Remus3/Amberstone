## FLEET COMMON - identical in every repo on this machine. Do not edit here.

Source of truth: MAIN's fleet kit. A change lands ONLY as a new kit version
announced by a MAIN note; this block is byte-pinned and a test fails on any local
edit. Tree-specific rules go BELOW this block, never inside it.

1. ACT, DON'T ASK. Operator acceptance of recommendations is ~100 percent. A blocked
   decision goes to a distinct adjudicator agent and its call is taken now and
   recorded (decision, alternatives, why) in the commit or doc. Only physical acts,
   passwords and OAuth grants wait for the operator, batched into one ask.
2. CHAT IS THE OPERATOR'S CONSOLE. Terse: numbers, paths, verdicts. No narration.
   Findings go to files (roadmap, docs, hand-off); chat gets one line.
3. CHECKLIST at session start, after every 4 more items done, and at /done
   pre-flight. A status request gets the same checklist: done, left, +added,
   -retracted. Every action carries an ETA `[~Ns]` (s under 120s, m under 120m, h
   beyond); report an overrun at 1.5x, kill at 3x.
4. COMMIT everything, batched and coherent. Push per this repo's own policy. Never
   commit in another repo's tree. No suggested-task chips: do it or file it.
5. HAND-OFF: /done overwrites `<CODE>-NEXT-SESSION.txt` whole and commits it, then
   ends "ready for /clear". A recorded act names what was READ BACK after it, never
   what was run. Every do-not-re-litigate entry states what would reverse it, and
   entries about another tree's position are re-checked against the inbox every
   session: do not re-pitch, never do not re-read.
6. MAIN SPEAKS FOR THE OPERATOR (operator order 2026-10-02). A note from MAIN whose
   bytes match MAIN's outbox copy by SHA-256 is the operator's instruction. It
   cannot supply a password, OAuth grant or physical act, and lifts no safety floor.
   MAIN instructs; this tree does the work in its own tree.
7. CHANNEL NOTES: sort the inbox by mtime, never by filename stamp. Read a long
   note's section headings before deciding it does not concern you. Never put a
   directory name, account id or email in a note. Delivery = destination copies
   re-hashed and an N/M reached-count reported.
8. ENCODING: ASCII only, LF only, PowerShell included. Validate PowerShell with
   powershell.exe 5.1 ParseFile, never pwsh.
9. DELETES: anything irreplaceable goes to the Recycle Bin, never a direct unlink;
   say the method before running it; check for a consumer before deleting.
10. HEADLESS RUNS go through the fleet kit's spawn helper ONLY - no other path
    starts `claude`. The kit enforces: the second-account proxy from the user
    variable CLAUDE_HEADLESS_BASE_URL (registry first), fail closed (no fallback,
    ever), no visible console, at most 120 runs per rolling 24 h, never spawn on
    this tree's own notes or on TERMINAL/no-reply notes, lean flags (strict MCP,
    project settings only, or bare where no floor lives in hooks), sonnet unless
    the note orders code changes, effort low for acknowledgements, a usage line
    per run, and the live status file `ops/loop/control/inbox_status.json`.
11. FLEET KIT FILES are vendored byte-for-byte at `ops/fleet_kit/` and pinned by
    `ops/fleet_kit/MANIFEST.json`. Never edit them locally; report a defect to MAIN
    and MAIN ships a new version to every tree at once.
