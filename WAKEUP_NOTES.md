# s140 wrap — 2026-05-09 (Phase 2.4 — moon_vision_server split)

## What shipped
- **`vision_server/` package** (new): split `moon_vision_server.py` (710 LOC) into 7 internal modules — `_config.py` (75), `_stats.py` (65), `_frame.py` (117), `_relay.py` (118), `_inference.py` (264), `_http.py` (245), `__init__.py` (79). Real code lives here.
- **`moon_vision_server.py`** (kept): reduced to 21-LOC entrypoint shim — `from vision_server import main; sys.exit(main())`. Preserves the file path that `RC-VisionServer` scheduled task and `dashboard/server.py:191` spawn-by-path.
- **`tools/build_portable.py`**: added `moon_vision_server.py` to `_ROOT_PY_FILES` (closed pre-existing bundle gap) + `vision_server` to `_SOURCE_PACKAGES`.
- **`docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`**: god-module table updated, archmap auto-regenerated.
- 386 tests pass, ruff clean, `:8889/health` verified post-restart (PID 17508→10476). Commit: **9cf262a** pushed → origin/main.

## Key decisions
- **Shim pattern, not package replacement**: `moon_vision_server.py` is spawned by file path from two callers (scheduled task XML + dashboard subprocess). Editing those would require touching frozen-adjacent task XML; keeping a 21-LOC shim is cheaper and preserves the contract.
- **Sub-file deviation from plan**: plan listed 4 files (frame_upload, frame_cache, tier_routes, sonnet_escalation). Actual = 6 internal because plan missed LCU relay, liveclient relay, stats, HTTP handler, config. Combined frame_upload+frame_cache (share state) and combined tier_routes+sonnet_escalation into `_inference.py` (both inference handlers feeding same stats).
- **Cross-module state**: `_frame` and `_relay` directly mutate `_stats._stats[k]["bytes"]` under `_stats._stats_lock`. Kept the direct mutation — wrapping it in setters would just create indirection.
- **Pre-existing bundle gap**: `moon_vision_server.py` was NEVER in `_ROOT_PY_FILES` — portable builds have been shipping without the vision server. Fix bundled with this change.

## Do NOT redo
- Don't try to import from `moon_vision_server` (Python module) — the file is path-spawned, not import-consumed. Use `from vision_server import …` instead.
- Don't delete `moon_vision_server.py` thinking it's dead code — RC-VisionServer scheduled task XML hardcodes that path.
- Don't switch `python.exe` → `pythonw.exe` in the task XML without operator approval; that's a console-window cosmetic, not a Phase 2.4 scope item.

## What's next
1. **Phase 6 — Bridge consolidation** — blocked on operator approval for frozen files (`bridge_post_result.py`, `bridge_pull_tasks.py`, `process-bridge-tasks.md`).
2. **Game-PC LCU agent not posting** — SessionStart anomaly flagged at session start; separate task, surface for diagnosis.
3. **Vision regions calibration** — blocked on live game.

# s138 wrap — 2026-05-09 (Phase 2.3 — coach_integration split)

## What shipped
- **`coach_integration/` package** (new): split `coach_integration.py` (1225 LOC, `\r\r\n` line-ending artifact) into `_profiles.py` (181 LOC), `_sr_prompt.py` (455 LOC), `_coach.py` (607 LOC), `__init__.py` (6 LOC facade). All frozen-file callers (`app/__init__.py`, `main.py`) unchanged.
- **`tools/build_portable.py`**: removed `"coach_integration.py"` from `_ROOT_PY_FILES`, added `"coach_integration"` to `_SOURCE_PACKAGES`.
- **`docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`**: archmap regenerated for new package sub-modules.
- **FUTUREPROOFING_PLAN.md** (`Desktop`): Phase 3.3 and Phase 2.3 marked done; status table updated.
- 386 tests pass, ruff 0 violations.

## Key decisions
- Actual structure was SR-only (not multi-mode dispatch) — planned `dispatch.py/budget.py/cache_keys.py/writers.py` split didn't match reality; used `_profiles/_sr_prompt/_coach` instead.
- File had `\r\r\n` double-CR endings making Python splitlines() double-count lines (2449 apparent, 1225 real). Stripped on extraction.
- Path fix: `Path(__file__).parent` → `.parent.parent` in `_sr_prompt.py` and `_coach.py` since files are now one level deeper.
- `main.py` (frozen) sets `_ci._APP_DIR = APP_DIR` — attribute injection onto package `__init__`; never READ, harmless.

## Do NOT redo
- Don't re-investigate the line-count discrepancy — it was `\r\r\n` endings, stripped at extraction.
- Don't try to put `CoachIntegration` in a smaller file — the class is naturally 578 lines.

## What's next
1. **Phase 2.2** — `game_reader.py` (1473 LOC) split into `core/game_reader/` package.
2. **Phase 4 remaining** — dispatch-level POST validation in `_dispatch.py` (low priority).
3. **Vision regions calibration** — blocked on live game.

# s137 wrap — 2026-05-08 (Phase 3.3 — Playwright panel snapshot tests)

## What shipped
- **`tests/snapshot_panels/`** (new): 6-fixture Playwright harness — lobby/sr/aram/arena/brawl/tft × 4 panels = 24 screenshots per run.
- **`tests/snapshot_panels/conftest.py`**: `_MockServer` (ThreadingHTTPServer serving `web/` + fixture-driven `/api/*`), `pw_browser` session-scoped fixture, `_WS_STUB` JS snippet.
- **`tests/snapshot_panels/test_panel_snapshots.py`**: parametrized `test_panels[fixture]` — loads fixture, waits for `#rn-action` coaching text (or 800ms for lobby), asserts all 4 panels visible, screenshots each.
- **`.github/workflows/ci.yml`**: added `playwright install --with-deps chromium` step + `panel snapshot tests` step.
- Commit: **02ed835** pushed → origin/main.

## Key decisions
- Root cause of flaky failures: the dashboard's WebSocket connects to the **real supervisor on :8891** (not just the mock HTTP server). The real supervisor sends live `mode="client"` health/state, overriding the fixture and hiding `#item-build`. Fix: `_WS_STUB` injected via `page.add_init_script()` makes `window.WebSocket` immediately fire `onclose` without connecting.
- SSE format: the mock sends `store["data"]` (raw `StateResponse` JSON with `mode_key`) directly. The JS `setupStateStream()` reads `st.mode_key`, not a WS-style envelope wrapper.
- Arena/TFT: both pass cleanly once WS is stubbed. TFT doesn't use `#item-build` for build paths but the panel IS visible (CSS only hides it for `data-mode="client"`).

## Do NOT redo
- Don't re-investigate the `#item-build` visibility issue — it was the WS (:8891) overriding fixture. Stubbing WS fixed it in 02ed835.
- Don't try to remove the WS stub; it's intentional isolation for test determinism.

## What's next
1. **Phase 2.3** — `coach_integration.py` (1217 LOC) split into `coach_integration/` package.
2. **Phase 4 remaining** — dispatch-level POST validation in `_dispatch.py` (low priority).
3. **Vision regions calibration** — blocked on live game.
